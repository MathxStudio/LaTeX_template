# LaTeX-Templates

This repository contains a custom LaTeX `.sty` file (`allan.sty`) tailored for math writing. Designed primarily for the author's personal convenience, it streamlines the creation of mathematical documents by providing specialized commands, environments, and styles.

I started this repository initially on the purpose of beautifying essays during mathematical modelling contests (first tried during MCM 2022), but it can also be used as a rather explicit and fancy way of displaying maths in LaTeX.

## Features
- **Optimized for Math Writing**: Simplifies notation and formatting for mathematical content.
- **Custom Commands**: Handy aliases and macros to reduce repetitive code.
- **Read-Only Development**: The repository is **tailored for personal use** and does not accept pull requests or modifications to aliases, but is welcome to **technical / programming advice**.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place the `.sty` file in your LaTeX project directory or a location included in the LaTeX path.
3. For a global setting, if you use MiKTeX as I do, go to the ‘Settings’ in the sidebar → ‘Directory’ tab, and put the file in one of the **TEXMF root directories** (create one if there isn't any).
4. Add `\usepackage{allan}` to your LaTeX document preamble to activate the template.

## Words on Eason's version:

> Being in the same mathematical modelling group [stOOrz](https://github.com/stOOrz-Mathematical-Modelling-Group), I noticed that it is a good but simple style for LaTeX. Therefore, for my own uses, I forked this repository and did some edits for easier formatting in my documents.
